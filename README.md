#Dogs and Cats Classifier 

A project for my Deep Learning module, developed by a 2nd-year student. This **model** classifies images of dogs and cats with ~98% accuracy.

#Live Demo

You can test my model online! Upload your picture in an interactive web-based app, hosted on *Hugging Face Spaces*.

#Technologies Used

* *Python*
* *TensorFlow & Keras:* For building and **training** the *model*.
* *Transfer Learning:* Using the MobileNetV2 architecture as a feature extractor.
* *Pandas & Matplotlib:* For **analyzing** and visualizing results.
* *Gradio:* For creating the interactive web-based interface.
* *Google Colab:* For training with a T4 GPU.
* *Hugging Face Spaces:* For deployment of the web application.
* *Git & Git LFS:* For version control and managing large model files.
